Linking Odoo with Big Data

The purpose of this project is to be futuristic!

From DataCentral(http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/big-data-20-mind-boggling-facts-everyone-must-read):

- The data volumes are exploding, more data has been created in the past two years than in the entire previous history of the human race.
- Data is growing faster than ever before and by the year 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human being on the planet.
- By then, our accumulated digital universe of data will grow from 4.4 zettabyets today to around 44 zettabytes, or 44 trillion gigabytes.
- Every second we create new data. For example, we perform 40,000 search queries every second (on Google alone), which makes it 3.5 searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year.
